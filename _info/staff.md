    Previous experience as a TA: None! First time. <br/>
      <i> "Hi! I'm a first year PhD student in CS, excited to be here and to help introduce you to the field. I first learned to program by writing web scrapers as an undergrad at UCLA, and then I got involved in a medical imaging lab that introduced me to research in CS. Since then I have worked as a software developer at a number of companies (including Procore in the SB area), and I have also worked as a researcher in the areas of machine learning and computer vision. Learning to write code is very rewarding and eye-opening, and I'm looking forward to sharing that experience with you." </i>

  <i> "Hello! I am a 4th year Computer Science. I was a tutor for this course last quarter so I have a lot of experience with questions that commonly arise. I came to UCSB with no prior programming experience and CS8 was my introduction to the field. Due to this I know how overwhelming and confusing some topics in Computer Science are and I can hopefully help you all get a better understanding based on my experience. I'm always glad to help with any sort of questions related to the class or the major. Some of my hobbies include  creating mobile applications, playing video games and going out hiking. A random tidbit about myself, my favorite animals are reptiles in particular turtles and snakes :). With that said, I look forward to helping you succeed in the course!" </i>
